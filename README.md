# Implant Stability Stats Lab

**Subtitle:** Disentangling multicollinearity and autocorrelation using Torque, ISQ, and BIC in implant dentistry.

## Story (clinical framing)

A multi-site practice wants clarity on early stability and 12‑month marginal bone change. At placement we record **Insertion Torque**; we measure **ISQ** at weeks 0/1/2/3/4/6/8; and we have a research proxy for **BIC (%)**. The clinical leads keep asking: "Which lever matters and when?" The statistics keep talking back: **autocorrelation** in repeated ISQ and **multicollinearity** among stability proxies.

You will act as the biostat-savvy clinician who turns this mess into understanding without fooling yourself or the surgeons in the room.

## Learning goals

- Diagnose **multicollinearity**: correlation heatmap, **VIF**, **condition number**.

- Remedy design overlap: variable selection, composite stability index, **ridge/lasso/elastic net**, **PCA/PLS**.

- Diagnose **autocorrelation**: residual **ACF**, **Durbin–Watson**, **Ljung–Box**.

- Remedy serial dependence: **lags**, **GLS/AR(1)**, **HAC (Newey–West)** standard errors.

- Communicate clinical takeaways responsibly.

## Data

Place `data/raw/implants_stability_300.csv` generated by Manus AI. Columns are wide-format (one row per implant/patient) including Torque, BIC, covariates, and ISQ at weeks `isq_w0, isq_w1, isq_w2, isq_w3, isq_w4, isq_w6, isq_w8`. You will reshape to long format in the notebooks when needed.

## How to run

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Open the notebooks in VS Code or Jupyter; they are Jupytext .py files.
```

## Deliverables

Completed notebooks with figures and reasoning.

≤1‑page summary: diagnostics, remedies, and clinical implications for study design.
